## ðŸ’¡Introduction
Creating a console-based banking simulator using the C programming language for your 5th-semester project is a great idea. 
Below is a detailed description of how you can structure and implement this project, including features like administrator and user login, 
and data storage in a binary file (record.bin).

## Project Overview
The project aims to simulate a simple banking system that allows both administrators and users to perform various banking operations. 
It will use a console-based interface and store data in a binary file for simplicity.

## Features
### User Authentication:
- The program should have two types of users: administrators and regular users.
- Administrators should be able to log in using a unique username and password.
- Regular users should also log in using their account credentials.

### Administrator Functions
- Create new user accounts: Administrators can create accounts for new customers by specifying their username, password, and initial balance.
- View user account details: Administrators can view the account details of any user, including their balance and transaction history.
- Delete user accounts: Administrators can delete user accounts when necessary.
- Change user passwords: Administrators should have the ability to reset user passwords.

### User Functions
- Check account balance.
- Deposit funds into their accounts.
- Withdraw funds from their accounts.
- View their transaction history

### Documentation
- Prepare clear documentation that explains how to compile, run, and use your banking simulator.
- Include information about the data file structure, input format, and any other relevant details.

### Project Submission:
- Submit your project along with source code, documentation, and a brief report detailing the design and implementation.
- Remember that this project is a significant undertaking, so break it down into manageable tasks and milestones.
- It's essential to plan, design, and test each component thoroughly to ensure a successful outcome. Good luck with your 5th-semester project!
